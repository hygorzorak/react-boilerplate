## Getting Started

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Build the production code:

```bash
npm run build
```

Test the unit code:

```bash
npm run test
or
npm run test:watch
```

Open the cypress console:

```bash
npm run cypress
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

### Development

You can start editing the page by modifying `pages/index.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.ts`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
